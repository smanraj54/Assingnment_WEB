## semi finctional prototype :

I Used wireframe.cc for creating my semi-functional prototype[11]

## Reason to chose this wireFrame:

I chose thios wireframe design because all my required data can be shown in this wireframe and it's easy to read for senior citizens and people in special needs. Not many colors to confuse them from the task they need to perform and as easy as singkle button add and remove of item.

## i missed to add yet:

Routing/Redirection is missing in this wireframe and the page.
